Title: Column-wise loading of large data frames for package authors
Version: 0.0-5
Authors@R: "Kirill MÃ¼ller <krlml+r@mailbox.org> [aut, cre]"
Description: When packaging data frames to a package, the entire data frame
    is loaded when first accessed.  This is impractical if the data frame
    contains many columns and only few of them are needed.  This package offers
    a workaround by providing functions to store and load data frames in
    one RDS file per column.
